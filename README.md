# DSA Pattern Practice

A focused repository to learn Data Structures & Algorithms with a pattern-based approach.

📁 Structure:
- Each folder = 1 DSA pattern
- Inside each: my attempt + online best solution
- `extras/`: Notes, roadmap, learning reflections

---

## 🔧 What’s This Repo?

This repo is built to:

- Solve DSA problems based on common patterns  
- Keep both my own logic and studied solutions  
- Note down key takeaways, dry runs, and thought process  

---

## 🔁 Problem-Solving Flow

1. Try the problem with my own logic  
2. If needed, refer to online solutions  
3. Save both versions with clear names  
4. Document learnings through notes  

---

## 💡 The Goal

- Build strong pattern recognition  
- Stay calm and confident with any question  
- Improve problem-solving step by step
